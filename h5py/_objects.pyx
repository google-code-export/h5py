# New strategy for identifier recycling management
#
# For objects like SpaceIDs and TypeIDs, close() operations only affect that
# single identifier.  So it's safe simply to set the .id attribute to 0, to
# avoid double-closing in the case of an identifier being recycled.
#
# For objects like FileIDs, a close() can remotely invalidate other objects.
# It's not enough to set the .id of the FileID to zero; if, for example, a
# DatasetID is open, it will be invalidated but still have a nonzero .id, which
# could lead to double-closing when it's eventually deallocated.
#
# In the latter case, we have to check all IDs in existence, and zero out their
# identifiers if they're invalid.
#
# Identifiers are tracked by two parallel Python lists.  One holds weakref
# objects which point to the ObjectID instances.  Weakrefs are used to ensure
# that an ObjectID which goes out of scope is actually collected.  The other
# list is an index containing the Python IDs (id(obj)) of the instances.  This
# provides a fast way to remove an object from the registry.
#
# The basic contract here is that once ._close() is called, the identifier is
# inert and will not participate in double-closing nonsense.  The hard part is
# making sure _close() is always called, in the case of action-at-a-distance
# calls such as H5Fclose in the case of H5P_CLOSE_STRONG.
#
# 1. On initialization:
#       * The HDF5 hid_t identifier is recorded as .id
#       * The object's Python ID and a weak reference are recorded
#           in parallel lists
#       * The attribute .locked is set to 0 (unlocked)
#       * The attribute .nonlocal_close is set to 0 (local close only)
#       * The attribute .manual_close is set to 0 (auto-close on __dealloc__)
#
# 2. When ._close() is called:
#       * If the identifier is locked or already closed
#           - Return without doing anything
#       * If the identifier is valid
#           - The HDF5 reference count is decremented (H5Idec_ref)
#       * The attribute .id is set to 0
#       * The Python ID and weakref are removed from the parallel lists 
#       * If .nonlocal_close is nonzero, the lists are swept for
#           invalid ObjectIDs
#           - Any invalid ObjectID is _close()-ed, which removes it from 
#             the lists.
#
# 3. When an object is deallocated:
#       * If .manual_close is not set
#           - The object is _close()-ed
#
# Locking:
#   * Whenever the parallel lists are accessed; on initialization and in
#       the _close() method
